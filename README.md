# BWM STE Extension
Script used for simulations and calculations of Spanning Tree Enumeration (STE) Best-Worst Method (BWM) extension.

# Environment setup
First create a new Python virtual environment with the following command `python -m venv .venv`

Activate the new virtaul environment in the terminal (ctrl+shift+p in VS Code > select Python interpreter; run 
`source ./venv/bin/activate` on a Mac or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows).

Then install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Open Jupyter-Lab
Once packages were installed and you're in the virtual environment run `jupyter-lab` to enter the Jupyter environment.

Open the test.ipynb notebook to see the code with manual STEBWM runs.
